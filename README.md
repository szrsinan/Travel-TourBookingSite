I successfully graduated from the Front-End Bootcamp program organized by Techcareer.net. I would like to thank the Techcareer.net family and our teacher Tunc Gulec, who made us learn by trusting and always supporting us during the bootcamp period.

In our project, we used sweetalert for general alerts and Angular.js as javascript library. With the decision of our teacher, we aimed to complete the site as a single-page.
